It is to adjust the paths.
After the program execution, two csv files are created, which consist of the list of paths. 
Each path is the address where the respective image is placed.


For the second step, the basic_approaches/basic_img_augumentation.ipynb file must be running.
The dataset is created from the classic augmented images and the corresponding masks. 
The number of dataset images must be specified, which is initialized as dataset_size.
